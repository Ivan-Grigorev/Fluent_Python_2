    "<p><b>Duck Typing</b>:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Definition</b>: A programming style where an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties rather than the object's actual type.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Example</b>: If an object has a <code>quack</code> method, it can be treated as a \"duck\" even if it doesn't inherit from a specific duck class.</p>\n",
    "<p><b>Goose Typing</b>:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Definition</b>: A variation of duck typing that also considers the types of the object's methods and attributes, ensuring they match expected types.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Example</b>: An object not only needs to have certain methods and attributes, but they must also adhere to specific types, e.g., method `quack` must take and return specific types.</p>\n",
    "<p><b>Static Typing</b>:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Definition</b>: A programming style where variable types are explicitly declared and determined at compile-time.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Example</b>: In languages like Java, you must declare a variable's type (e.g., `int x = 5;`), and it cannot change.</p>\n",
    "<p><b>Static Duck Typing</b>:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Definition</b>: A hybrid approach that combines static typing with duck typing.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Example</b>: A function can specify that it expects an object that has a particular method signature, allowing type-checking at compile time while maintaining flexibility in what kinds of objects can be passed in.</p>"

    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Definition</b>: In Python, dynamic protocols are abstract base classes (ABCs) that define a set of methods and attributes that an object must implement to be considered compliant with the protocol. These protocols are typically defined in the <code>collections</code> or <code>typing</code> module.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Example</b>: The <code>Sequence</code> protocol from the <code>collections</code> module defines a set of methods (<code>__getitem__</code>, <code>__len__</code>, etc.) that an object must implement to be considered a sequence.</p>\n",

    "<p><b>Static Protocol</b>:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Definition</b>: Python static protocols are similar to dynamic protocols but make use of the <code>typing.Protocol</code> class from the <code>typing</code> module. These protocols use type hints to define the expected interface (methods and attributes) of a class at static type-checking time. Static protocols provide better tooling support and more explicit type checking.<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;<b>Example</b>: A protocol can define that an object must have certain methods and attributes. For instance, a <code>Printable</code> protocol may require an object to implement a <code>print</code> method.</p>"
